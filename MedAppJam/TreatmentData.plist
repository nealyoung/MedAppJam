			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Cisplatin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Cisplatin is a drug that binds to the DNA in rapidly dividing cells and creates a bridge between portions of the DNA that does not allow further multiplycation of the cells. This effectively breaks the cell and causes it to die. The small part of the DNA that is bound is a DNA base called Guanine.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Damage to the kidneys, damage to nerves, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, electrolyte disturbance, bone marrow suppression, and hemolytic anemia.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Carboplatin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Carboplatin is an alkylating agent that works in three ways: 1. It attaches special molecules called alkyl groups onto DNA, which damages the DNA and does not allow the cell to multiply anymore. 2. Carboplatin bridges two strands of DNA together, which does not allow them to separate or allow the cell to divide and multiply. 3. Carboplatin causes errors to be made when the cancer cell is replicating. All three of these things cause the cancer cell to die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Neutropenia or a drop in white blood cells that can predispose a patient to infection. Tiredness and breathlessness due to low blood cells, also known as anemia. Easy bruising due to low platelets. Kidney damage. Loss of fertility or loss of periods in women. Nausea. Vomiting.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Vinorelbine</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Vinorelbine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the portion of the cancer cell that initiates division and multiplycation. This part of the cell is called the mitotic spindle. Without a functional mitotic spindle, the cell cannot be pulled apart and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Peripheral neuropathy that generally begins in the hands and feet, decreased resistance to infection, easy bleeding or bruising due to anemia, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, feelings of fatigue and weakness, and on occasion inflammation and pain in the vein where the drug is administered. </string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Gemcitabine</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks an enzyme called thymidylate synthetase. Thymidylate synthetase is required for DNA in cancer cells to continue to replicate. Without this enzyme the cell stops relicating and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>Usually a 4-week schedule, 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle: 3-week schedule; 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Flu-like symptoms, fever (within 6-12 hours after the first dose), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, skin rash, weakness, hair loss, mouth sores, difficulty sleeping, and shortness of breath.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Paclitaxel (Taxol)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug that acts on infrastructure within the cancer cells and causes the cells to become stuck while trying to divide. The reason these cells become stuck is because Paclitaxel prevents the mitotic spindle, an important player in cell separation, from breaking down. At this point, cells will stop dividing and die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cell levels predisposing to infection, low platelet levels causing easy bleeding and bruising, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, pain, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and liver damage.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Docetaxel (Taxotere)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that prevents cells from making a crane-like structure, called the mitotic spindle, that is necessary to pull cells apart during replication. If cancer cells cannot separate from one cell into two cells, cell division is stopped and the cell dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. Administered every 3 weeks during the cycles.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cells predisposing to infection, anemia, low platelet levels, fevers, hair loss, and liver dysfunction.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Doxorubicin</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Doxorubin is a chemotherapy drug that causes DNA to break by intercalation. Basically, another normally acting ezyme breaks the cancer cell DNA to unwind it and prepare it for replication, however, at this point Doxorubicin interupts the unwinding by placing itself between the tangled strands of DNA. Since the DNA has been blocked from resealing itself after untangling, the cell cannot continue to replicate and dies.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.</string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Turns urine red/orange - this is not harmful to the patient, low WBC levels that can predispose the patient to infection, causes sores on the mouth and lips, low platelt counts, and can injure the heart muscle causing congestive heart failure during or after treatment.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Etoposide</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Etoposide is a type of chemotherapy drug that blocks a protein called topoisomerase II that keeps the DNA inside the cells from tangling and breaking. Without this enzyme, the DNA tangles up on itself and breaks causing the cell to die. Cancers rely on topoisomerase more than regular cells because they multiply more than regular cells.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Kidney damage, damage to a fetus during pregnancy or damage to a baby if breastfeeding during treatment, and infertility.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Pemetrexed (Alimta)</string>
			<key>Mechanism</key>
			<string>Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that inhibits three enzymes: thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. These enzymes are required to make the building blocks of DNA. Without these enzymes, cancer cells do not have enough building blocks to make a whole DNA sequence and since replication is not possible without DNA, the cancer cells die.</string>
			<key>Timeline</key>
			<string>3 to 6 months with approximately 4 to 8 cycles of treatment. </string>
			<key>SideEffects</key>
			<string>Low white blood cell levels predisposing to infection, low red blood cell counts, anemia, mental fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, oral sores, loss of appetite, rash, and constipation.</string>

		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test measures the amount of this protein that may appear in the blood of some people who have certain kinds of cancers, especially large intestine (colon and rectal) cancer. It may also be present in people with cancer of the pancreas, breast, ovary, or lung.</string>
			<key>HowTested</key>
			<string>The health professional taking a sample of your blood will:\n\nWrap an elastic band around your upper arm to stop the flow of blood. This makes the veins below the band larger so it is easier to put a needle into the vein.\n\nClean the needle site with alcohol.\n\nPut the needle into the vein. More than one needle stick may be needed.\n\nAttach a tube to the needle to fill it with blood.\n\nRemove the band from your arm when enough blood is collected.\n\nPut a gauze pad or cotton ball over the needle site as the needle is removed.\n\nPut pressure to the site and then put on a bandage.</string>
			<key>Values</key>
			<string>Normal: Less than 5 nanograms per milliliter\n\nMany conditions can change your CEA levels. Your doctor will discuss any significant abnormal results with you in relation to your symptoms and medical history.</string>
			<key>Interpretation</key>
			<string>High values of CEA can indicate:\n\nCancer of the colon, lung, pancreas, breast, or ovary may be present.\n\nCancer may not be responding to treatment.\n\nCancer may have returned after treatment. A steadily rising CEA may be the first sign that cancer has come back after treatment. Also, people with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer) may have high CEA levels if their original cancer produced this protein before treatment.\n\nAnother condition or disease is present, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), or an obstructed bile duct.</string>

	<key>Surgery</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>ProcedureName</key>
			<string>Pneumonectomy</string>
			<key>Information</key>
			<string>With a standard pneumonectomy, either the right lung (which contains 3 lobes) or the left lung (containing 2 lobes) is removed.  A pneumonectomy is most commonly done as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, when a less invasive procedure, such as a lobectomy, cannot remove the entire tumor. This may occur if the tumor is large, if it has spread beyond a single lobe, or if it is located in the central area of the lungs.  Because a pneumonectomy involves the removal of an entire lung, the procedure is usually reserved for those people who have adequate lung function and will be able to tolerate living with only one lung. That said, many people have gone on to live active lives following a pneumonectomy.</string>
			<key>Preparation</key>
			<string>The night before surgery, your doctor will recommend that you “fast” – that is, not eat or drink anything (even water) for at least 8 hours.  On the morning of your surgery, a nurse will ask you several questions and place an IV (intravenous line) in your arm. She will also fit you with monitors so that your blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels can be monitored throughout surgery. Your surgeon will visit to again discuss the procedure and ask you to sign a consent form. The anesthesiologist will also visit to talk about the anesthesia you will be given, and ask about any problems you or your family members have experienced with anesthesia in the past. The operating room staff will guide your family to a waiting area, where the surgical staff can keep them updated on your progress and speak with them when your surgery is done.</string>
			<key>Recovery</key>
			<string>When your surgery is complete, you will be taken to the recovery room where you will monitored closely for several hours. In some cases, you may be taken directly to the intensive care unit (ICU). Following recovery, most people spend the first several days in the ICU. For the first day, your breathing may be assisted with a ventilator. Since this can cause some anxiety, you will be given medications that keep you very drowsy until the tube is removed.  When the ventilator is removed and you become less sleepy, a respiratory therapist will ask you to cough, and will assist you in the use of an incentive spirometer. This is a device that you breathe into in order to exercise your lungs, and to help keep the small air sacs in your lungs open.  When you are able, the nursing staff will help you sit, and then encourage you to get up and walk with assistance. You may not feel like being active, but increasing your activity will help you regain your strength more quickly, and reduces the risk of developing blood clots. Most people spend at least 6 to 10 days in the hospital following surgery.  Some people return to work after 8 weeks, but your doctor will give you special restrictions, such as avoiding any heavy lifting. It will also take time for your remaining lung to take over, and shortness of breath may persist for several months following surgery.</string>
